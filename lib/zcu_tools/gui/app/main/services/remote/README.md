# `gui.app.main.services.remote` — measure-gui RemoteControlAdapter

**Last updated:** 2026-07-12 — owner scheduler, gate presence, and UI adapters

This package is the GUI-process side of measure-gui remote control. It exposes a
local NDJSON RPC surface over the live `Controller`, marshals State-owned work onto
the injected owner scheduler, serializes selected events, and enforces measure-gui policy
such as resource-version guards and editor lifecycle tracking.

The agent-facing MCP bridge lives in `zcu_tools.mcp.measure`. This package does
not declare MCP tools and does not own stdio transport.

## Layout

- `service.py`：`RemoteControlAdapter`, a measure-gui subclass of shared
  `RemoteControlServiceBase`; owns client context, guard hooks, diagnostics, and
  editor cleanup.
- `dispatch.py`：runtime method registry projection; keeps the public
  `METHOD_REGISTRY` import path stable.
- `handlers/`：grouped wire method handlers bound to controller, control facets,
  or render-view calls.
- `method_specs.py`：Qt-free public projection for wire method schema, timeouts,
  and MCP generation metadata.
- `method_entries/`：single registration source for method name, handler ref,
  `MethodSpec`, MCP exposure policy, and `ParamSpec` shorthands. Handler refs
  are resolved only by the dispatch projection.
- `events.py`：domain payload type to wire event serializer mapping.
- `dialogs.py`：wire-stable dialog names.
- `path_resolver.py`：dotted-path mutation and settable-tree projection for
  cfg-editor sessions.
- `wire_version.py`：measure-gui wire contract version and GUI code revision.

Shared transport primitives live in `zcu_tools.gui.remote`: NDJSON framing,
typed request/reply/error envelope, socket endpoint, owner-scheduler dispatch, and
router scaffolding.

## Wire Contract

```text
Request  -> {"id": "...", "method": "tab.run_start", "params": {...}}
Reply    <- {"id": "...", "ok": true, "result": {...}}
Reply    <- {"id": "...", "ok": false, "error": {"code": "...", "message": "...", "reason": "..."}}
Push     <- {"event": "...", "payload": {...}, "seq": 123, "origin": {"kind": "agent", "operation_id": "7"}}
```

- One connection has at most one in-flight RPC.
- Request and response roots are JSON objects.
- Line size is bounded by UTF-8 byte length.
- Error codes are closed and typed in `gui.remote.errors`.
- `wire.version` is available before auth; all other methods require auth when a
  token is configured.
- Loopback without token means any same-user local process can control the GUI.

## Dispatch And Threads

Normal handlers run on the State owner thread through the injected `OwnerScheduler`.
The Qt composition root supplies `QtOwnerScheduler`; headless tests use
`ManualOwnerScheduler`. Handler exceptions become typed error envelopes.

Caller-correctable producer exceptions以remote-independent `ExpectedErrorCategory`分類。shared
dispatch在main/off-main兩條路徑先讓direct `RemoteError`穿透，再以nominal `ExpectedError`作為
唯一generic gate：`INVALID_INPUT`映射`INVALID_PARAMS`，`FAILED_PRECONDITION`映射
`PRECONDITION_FAILED`，message/reason原樣保留且generic data固定為`None`。handler-local
request coercion與structured policies（例如arb waveform data）仍由原handler擁有。

ordinary `RuntimeError`、ProviderError、I/O/persistence與invariant failure進controller-error
branch並記錄traceback。translator projection failure也由同一controller branch收斂，不會留下
empty reply holder（ADR-0047）。

Only bounded wait handlers run off-main:

- `operation.await`
- `notify.await`

Off-main handlers only consume thread-safe channels. They do not read or mutate
main-thread-owned state, version tables, controller objects, editor sessions, or
Qt widgets.

## Events And Diagnostics

Event push is still available on the wire for GUI/internal consumers. Event
payloads use requery hints for complex objects; live Python objects never cross
the wire.
EventBus pushes add process-wide `seq` and `origin={kind, operation_id}` without
changing the event name or payload shape. The per-connection `client_id` is
RPC-side bookkeeping and is deliberately omitted. Diagnostic and cfg-editor
pushes are not EventBus broadcasts and retain `{event, payload}`.
Event serializers and NDJSON encoding run only when the endpoint finds a matching
live subscriber. Recipient selection is two-phase: payload construction stays on
the Qt main thread and outside the endpoint registry lock, then subscribe state
and link liveness are revalidated immediately before enqueue. One event is built
once for any number of matching clients; unsubscribe/disconnect completed first
cannot receive a late push.
Internal tab interaction/content payloads include closed domain facts used by the
Qt reaction matrix. Their serializers deliberately omit those facts and preserve
the existing event names and `{tab_id, requery}` shape.

Cfg-editor change producers pass a payload factory rather than transport state.
Editor versions still bump on every edit; `current_targets()` is materialized and projected once
only when an `editor_id` subscriber exists. `editor_closed` removes a client's
subscription only after its close push is accepted by that client's queue.

Diagnostics are separate from EventBus. The controller pushes diagnostics to the
remote adapter sink, which broadcasts diagnostic payloads to clients regardless
of subscription. MCP keeps diagnostics in a dedicated queue and automatically
subscribes to the existing low-frequency event catalog; both queues piggyback on
the next successful tool reply.

Agent-visible async completion comes from `gui_op_poll` / `gui_op_wait`, not
from resource-change events.

## Version Handshake

The launch/connect note reports three numbers:

- `WIRE_VERSION`：GUI RPC contract. MCP pins and compares this value.
- `GUI_VERSION`：GUI process code revision. It is displayed, not compared.
- `MCP_VERSION`：MCP bridge code revision. It is displayed by the bridge, not
  owned here.

Current measure-gui values are `WIRE_VERSION = 51`, `GUI_VERSION = 71`, and
`MCP_VERSION = 73`（defined in `zcu_tools.mcp.measure.server`）。WIRE 51新增
`state.hardware_gate` read model；GUI 70把service completion改為Qt-free typed facts；
GUI 71把cfg input enhancer與exception presenter移至Qt UI adapters；MCP 73把gate
presence折入`gui_overview.hardware_gate`。

Only wire-contract changes bump `WIRE_VERSION`. GUI-internal changes that need a
reload signal bump `GUI_VERSION`; MCP-only tool/policy changes bump
`MCP_VERSION`.

## Resource-Version Guard

The GUI maintains a monotonic resource version table for context, SoC, devices,
tabs, results, save paths, and editor sessions. Guarded mutation methods accept
wire-hidden `expected_versions`; the remote adapter compares them atomically on
the main thread before calling the controller.

MCP owns the agent baseline:

- guarded mutations send expected versions derived from policy tables;
- successful writes refresh the baseline;
- pure reads refresh only keys they fully reveal;
- stale rejection is translated into semantic tool errors for the agent.

Version numbers are a bridge concern. Agents see stale-resource descriptions, not
raw counters.

A stale guarded mutation has one wire-level recovery contract. The server returns
`PRECONDITION_FAILED` with `data={"stale": [...]}`, where `stale` lists every
resource whose current version no longer matches the caller baseline. The client
must re-snapshot each listed resource through its corresponding read method,
refresh those baselines, and then retry the mutation with fresh
`expected_versions`. It must not retry against the old snapshots. Stale conflicts
do not add another `ErrorCode`; a future Web adapter may translate this existing
failure into an HTTP-specific status without changing the wire enum (ADR-0052).

## Method Surface

The wire surface is grouped by ownership:

- `startup.*` / `result_scope.*`：project and result-scope setup.
- `context.*`：MetaDict / ModuleLibrary / active context operations through
  `ContextControlPort`; role-catalog create/list stays on the app controller.
- `soc.*`：mock or remote SoC connection.
- `device.*`：device connect/disconnect/setup/snapshot through `DeviceControlPort`.
- `predictor.*`：Fluxonium predictor load, edit, clear, and predictions through
  `PredictorControlPort`.
- `tab.*`：tab lifecycle, cfg discovery/edit, run, load, save, figures.
- `analyze.*` / `post_analyze.*`：primary and secondary analysis.
- `writeback.*`：analysis result writeback preview and apply.
- `editor.*`：headless cfg-editor session lifecycle.
- `operation.*` / `notify.*`：generic waits, polls, progress, prompt replies.
- `arb_waveform.*`：qubit-scoped arbitrary waveform asset operations.
- `value.*`：read-only session value lookup through `ContextControlPort`.

`method_entries/` is the registration SSOT. Adding an agent-visible method
requires one entry containing the wire method name, handler ref, method spec, MCP
mapping or override, and tests for generation / guard policy. `method_specs.py`
remains the Qt-free public projection used by MCP generation.

## Cfg Editing

`path_resolver.py`只把binding `SettableTarget`投影成flat/tree wire view與prefix query，禁止
field/editor subtype grammar。Setter只接受listing canonical leaf；legacy `.sweep.*`/`.value.*`
zero-mutation拒絕並給replacement。Tab/writeback成功batch回final net path diff。

`tab.get_cfg` returns the nested settable value tree for discovery. Mutations use
dotted paths through `tab.set_cfg` or `editor.set_field`.

Scalar values may be direct values, tagged eval values, or tagged value refs.
Eval values store a resolved snapshot at set/lower time. Value refs resolve once
through the session value lookup and then become direct scalars.

Sweep nodes appear as editable subtrees, not as lowered `SweepCfg` objects.
`SweepSpec` exposes `start` / `stop` / `expts` / `step`; `CenteredSweepSpec`
exposes `center` / `span` / `expts` / `step`. `editor.set_field` accepts the same
dotted edge paths that `tab.get_cfg` reports.

Headless editor sessions are owned by `CfgEditorService`. Agent-created sessions
are garbage-collected on commit/discard/client drop; UI-owned sessions are tied
to their owner widget or tab.

## Operation Handles

Start methods return operation ids on the wire. MCP captures those ids and
returns opaque handles to the agent. Generic poll/wait reports status, progress,
user feedback, cancellation, timeout, or failure; figures, summaries, and device
snapshots are read through typed getters after completion.

`soc.connect` is synchronous and does not enter the operation-handle table.

## Launch / Shutdown

The GUI launcher starts the remote-control socket after the main window exists.
Shutdown flows through the same MainWindow close path as the UI, persists state,
marks the controller shutting down, stops the remote service, and then closes Qt
resources.

`gui_launch` starts a new GUI process and expects the requested port to be free.
`gui_bridge_connect` attaches to an already-running GUI.
